[Projects Technologies/Dependecies:]
- Java 17
- SpringBoot
- JPA
- PostgreSQl 14.2
- Maven
- embedded TomcatServer
- Lombok (used lombok in order to have better readability and less boilerplate code)

In order to test the implemented functionalities used Postman to generate the requests

Main pusprose for this web api project is to handle basic CRUD request for two entities **Match**, **MatchOdds**
For each Î¿f these two entities was made 2 respectively **Cotrollers** and **Repository**. Each Repository extends **JpaRepository**
in order to have basic functionalities from jpa (create,read,update,delete etc).

Each **Controller** implements basic HTTP requests using spring web annotation Mapping for those incoming requests.
Used **@RequestBody, @PathVariable, @RequestParam** to get incoming Object,values.

Created entity Match based on the description with id,description,team_a,team_b,match_time,match_date,sport.
Used hibernate in order to autocreate tables in our database based on our Entities values and properites. Also
create MatchOdds entity with **@ManytoOne** connection with Match entity in order to have a ForeignKey on **match_id** between
these two Entities.

In application.properties is defined all properties that are needed in order JPA connect
to database (creds and other hibernates properties to autogenerate database).
