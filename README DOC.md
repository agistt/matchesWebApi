In order to test the implemented functionalities used Postman to generate the requests

Main pusprose for this web api project is to handle basic CRUD request for two entities **Match**, **MatchOdds**
For each Î¿f these two entities was made 2 respectively **Cotrollers** and **Repository**. Each Repository extends **JpaRepository**
in order to have basic functionalities from jpa (create,read,update,delete etc).

Each **Controller** implements basic HTTP requests using spring web annotation Mapping for those incoming requests.
Used **@RequestBody, @PathVariable, @RequestParam** to get incoming Object,values.

Created entity Match with id,description,team_a,team_b,match_time,match_date,sport.
Used hibernate in order to autocreate tables in our database based on our Entities values and properites. Also
create MatchOdds entity with **@ManytoOne** connection with Match entity in order to have a ForeignKey on **match_id** between
these two Entities.

In application.properties is defined all properties that are needed in order JPA connect
to database (creds and other hibernates properties to autogenerate database).

> For testing this WebAPI have to make some basic modifications in credentials(username,password,url) in application.properties
> in order to connect successfully to the database. First time running set spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto= update value to create 
> in order to create the tables in DB
